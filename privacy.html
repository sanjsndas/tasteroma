            <p class="text-md mb-8 leading-relaxed">
                Tasteroma adheres to a standard procedure of utilizing log files. These files automatically record information about visitors when they access websites. This is a common practice across almost all hosting companies and constitutes a part of hosting services' analytics. The data collected by log files typically includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, the type of browser you are using, your Internet Service Provider (ISP), date and time stamps of your visits, referring and exit pages, and potentially the number of clicks you make on various elements. It's important to note that this information is not linked to any data that is personally identifiable. The primary purpose of this collected information is for analyzing trends in website usage, administering the site effectively, tracking users' movement patterns within the website to understand popular sections, and gathering broad demographic information to better serve our user base. This helps us optimize site performance and content delivery without identifying individual users.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold text-zesty-orange mb-6">Cookies and Web Beacons</h3>
            <p class="text-md mb-8 leading-relaxed">

These cookies are primarily used to store information, including visitors' preferences and records of the pages on the website that the visitor has accessed or visited. The information gathered from cookies is instrumental in optimizing the users' experience by customizing our web page content. For example, we might tailor content based on your browser type, language preferences, or other information to make your visits more efficient and personalized. This allows us to remember your settings, log you in automatically, or suggest content relevant to your interests.

We strongly encourage parents and guardians to actively observe, participate in, and/or monitor and guide their children's online activities. Tasteroma is not intended for use by children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect any Personal Identifiable Information from children in this age group.
